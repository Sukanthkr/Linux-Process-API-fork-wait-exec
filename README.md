Ex02-Linux Process API-fork(), wait(), exec()
# Ex02-OS-Linux-Process API - fork(), wait(), exec()
Operating systems Lab exercise


# AIM:
To write C Program that uses Linux Process API - fork(), wait(), exec()

# DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Navigate to any Linux environment installed on the system or installed inside a virtual environment like virtual box/vmware or online linux JSLinux (https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192) or docker.

### Step 2:

Write the C Program using Linux Process API - fork(), wait(), exec()

### Step 3:

Test the C Program for the desired output. 

# PROGRAM:

## C Program to print process ID and parent Process ID using Linux API system calls


## OUTPUT

### RESULT:
Thus the program to implement the creation of a process using fork() API is written and verified using C programming.

## C Program to create new process using Linux API system calls exec():


## OUTPUT



### RESULT:
Thus the program to implement the creation of a process using exec() API is written and verified using C programming.


## C Program to execute Linux system commands using Linux API system calls exit() , wait():


   

## OUTPUT




### RESULT:
Thus the program to implement the creation of a process using exit() , wait() API is written and verified using C programming.


# RESULT:
The programs are executed successfully.
